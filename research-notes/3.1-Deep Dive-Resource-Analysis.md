### Topic 1: Automated Vulnerability Assessment Tool Development

## Resource 1 Citation: Magsar, Q. (2025). Enhancing automated penetration testing with minimal human intervention: The AutoPentester LLM agent framework. SSRN.  
- Type: Academic Research Paper 
- Synopsis: This research introduces AutoPentester, an automated penetration testing framework that uses AI and command-line security tools to reduce manual work during vulnerability assessments. The system integrates Nmap and Metasploit while using reasoning to decide attack steps. It is valuable because it demonstrates real methods for automating cybersecurity tasks, similar to what I would apply in a Python vulnerability tool.

- Rating: 5/5 – Highly relevant for tool automation in security testing.

## Resource 2 Citation: Ifflander, L. (2025). Automated security assessment in educational environments: A novel approach to XSS vulnerability detection for programming assignments. ABP 2025. 
- Type: Academic Conference Paper 
- Synopsis: This paper presents a system for automatically detecting cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. It uses API-based validation and browser scripting to scan inputs for stored and reflected XSS attacks. This source is useful because it applies automation techniques to vulnerability detection, supporting ideas for building scanning logic.  Relevance
