### Topic 1: Automated Vulnerability Assessment Tool Development

## 1) Citation: OWASP. (2024). Nettacker – Automated Penetration Testing Framework. GitHub. https://github.com/OWASP/Nettacker
- Project Type: Security Tool / Automated Penetration Testing Framework
- Synopsis: Nettacker is an open-source, Python-based automated penetration testing and reconnaissance framework that combines modules for port/service scanning, subdomain enumeration, directory fuzzing, credential brute-forcing, and vulnerability checks. It supports multi-threaded scans, multiple output formats (JSON/HTML/CSV), a REST API and Web UI, and integrations for CI/CD. Nettacker is valuable for a Python vulnerability-assessment project because it demonstrates modular automation, scanning orchestration, and reporting features to emulate or integrate into a custom tool. Limitations/dependencies: requires Python (Poetry/pyproject), network permission to test, and careful use to avoid unintended scanning; some modules may need maintenance. - Project statistics: ~4.5k stars, ~922 forks, actively maintained — last updated (project page) Oct 13, 2025.
- Direct Link: https://github.com/OWASP/Nettacker
- Docs / Demo: https://nettacker.readthedocs.io
Relevance Rating: 5/5 — Highly relevant, Nettacker is a full featured example of automated vulnerability assessment and provides architectural patterns I can reuse or learn from.

## 2) Citation: 1N3. (2020). BlackWidow – Python web application scanner & OSINT spider. GitHub. https://github.com/1N3/BlackWidow
- Project Type: Security Tool / Web Application Scanner & OSINT Spider
- Synopsis: BlackWidow is a Python tool that scans websites to collect URLs, parameters, subdomains, emails, and phone numbers, and includes an Inject-X fuzzer to test dynamic parameters for common OWASP vulnerabilities. It automatically saves results and can be run via Docker. This project is useful for automated vulnerability assessment because it shows practical URL discovery, parameter extraction, and lightweight fuzzing techniques that can be integrated into a Python scanner. Limitations/dependencies: older project with limited recent maintenance; requires Python dependencies from requirements.txt and responsible/authorized use only. Project statistics: ~1.7k stars, ~384 forks, last release noted Jul 19, 2020 (latest activity less frequent).
- Direct Link: https://github.com/1N3/BlackWidow
- Demo / Author site: https://sn1persecurity.com
- Relevance Rating: 4/5 — Very relevant for web-app scanning and parameter fuzzing; slightly lower rating because the repo is older and may need updates to run reliably on modern systems.
