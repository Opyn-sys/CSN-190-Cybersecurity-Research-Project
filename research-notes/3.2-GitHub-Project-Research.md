### Topic 1: Automated Vulnerability Assessment Tool Development

## 1) Citation: OWASP. (2024). Nettacker – Automated Penetration Testing Framework. GitHub. https://github.com/OWASP/Nettacker
- Project Type: Security Tool / Automated Penetration Testing Framework
- Synopsis: Nettacker is an open-source, Python-based automated penetration testing and reconnaissance framework that combines modules for port/service scanning, subdomain enumeration, directory fuzzing, credential brute-forcing, and vulnerability checks. It supports multi-threaded scans, multiple output formats (JSON/HTML/CSV), a REST API and Web UI, and integrations for CI/CD. Nettacker is valuable for a Python vulnerability-assessment project because it demonstrates modular automation, scanning orchestration, and reporting features to emulate or integrate into a custom tool. Limitations/dependencies: requires Python (Poetry/pyproject), network permission to test, and careful use to avoid unintended scanning; some modules may need maintenance. - Project statistics: ~4.5k stars, ~922 forks, actively maintained — last updated (project page) Oct 13, 2025.
- Direct Link: https://github.com/OWASP/Nettacker
- Docs / Demo: https://nettacker.readthedocs.io
Relevance Rating: 5/5 — Highly relevant, Nettacker is a full featured example of automated vulnerability assessment and provides architectural patterns I can reuse or learn from.

## 2) Citation: 1N3. (2020). BlackWidow – Python web application scanner & OSINT spider. GitHub. https://github.com/1N3/BlackWidow
- Project Type: Security Tool / Web Application Scanner & OSINT Spider
- Synopsis: BlackWidow is a Python tool that scans websites to collect URLs, parameters, subdomains, emails, and phone numbers, and includes an Inject-X fuzzer to test dynamic parameters for common OWASP vulnerabilities. It automatically saves results and can be run via Docker. This project is useful for automated vulnerability assessment because it shows practical URL discovery, parameter extraction, and lightweight fuzzing techniques that can be integrated into a Python scanner.
- Limitations/dependencies: older project with limited recent maintenance; requires Python dependencies from requirements.txt and responsible/authorized use only. Project statistics: ~1.7k stars, ~384 forks, last release noted Jul 19, 2020 (latest activity less frequent).
- Direct Link: https://github.com/1N3/BlackWidow
- Demo / Author site: https://sn1persecurity.com
- Relevance Rating: 4/5 — Very relevant for web-app scanning and parameter fuzzing; slightly lower rating because the repo is older and may need updates to run reliably on modern systems.

### Topic 2: Ransomware Evolution and Defense Strategies

## 1) Citation: StevenBlack. (2025). hosts — Unified hosts file with base extensions. GitHub. https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts
- Project Type: Utility Script / Threat-Filtering List
- Synopsis: This repository aggregates and consolidates multiple curated hosts files into a unified hosts file for blocking ads, trackers, malware, and malicious domains. It includes variants and extensions (adware, malware, social media, etc.), scripts to generate and update hosts files, and usage instructions for different platforms. It’s valuable for ransomware defense research because blocking known malicious domains reduces exposure to phishing, and payload infrastructure.
- Limitations: it’s a preventive list, requires periodic updates, and may produce false positives for some domains. OS level hosts file access or a hosts manager tool. Project stats: ~29.1k stars, ~2.4k forks, last updated Oct 17, 2025. 
- Relevance Rating: 4/5 — Highly relevant for the prevention layer of defensive strategy (reduces ability of ransomware actors to reach or download payloads). It’s not a detection/IR tool, so it complements but does not replace endpoint detection or backup strategies.

### 2) Citation: mitchellkrogza. (2025). nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker. GitHub. https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker
- Project Type: Security Tool / Nginx Blocking & Mitigation Framework
- Synopsis: This project supplies configuration files, lists, and installation scripts to block bad bots, malicious user-agents, spam referrers, vulnerability scanners, malware/adware domains, and other hostile web traffic at the Nginx level. It supports auto-install scripts, fail2ban integration, and manual configuration templates for rate limiting and IP/user-agent blocking. It’s valuable for ransomware defense because it helps harden public-facing web services, reducing attack surface and opportunistic scanning that can lead to exploitation. 
- Limitations: requires Nginx admin access to deploy, careful tuning to avoid blocking legitimate traffic, and ongoing updates to keep blocklists current. Project stats: ~4.5k stars, ~507 forks, active maintenance with many commits (version V4.2025.10.x). 
- Relevance Rating: 4/5 — Very relevant to perimeter hardening and reducing exposure to automated scanners and malicious crawlers that can discover vulnerabilities. Practical for organizations running Nginx-based services.
